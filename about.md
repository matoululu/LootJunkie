  <h1>LootJunkie</h1>
  <p>LootJunkie was created to mimic the experience of opening Loot boxes in Overwatch. As of lately the website has also been expanded to support card packs in Hearthstone.</p>
  <p>LootJunkie's goal is to maintain an up-to-date item database with as accurate odds as possible. Using community driven data LootJunkie succeeds in creating a fun and accurate loot box opening experience.</p>
