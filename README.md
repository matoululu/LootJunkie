# LootJunkie
LootJunkie is an Overwatch loot box simulator where you can open Overwatch loot boxes for free!

I've uploaded the current version of LootJunkie which is pretty polished at this point. Any new changes will be updates or upgrades.

Play it at [LootJunkie.xyz](https://matoululu.github.io/LootJunkie/)

# Todo
1. Add more appropriate images to items.
2. Add a better opening sound.
3. Improve animations
4. Clean up code
